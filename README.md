## 🎯 Project Overview
This project proposes a **deep learning and computer vision-based system** to compute the probability of road accidents and detect unsafe driving behaviors.

### Proposed Use Cases:
1. 🚓 Over-speeding detection  
2. 🚦 Traffic law violation detection  
3. 🚗 Tailgating detection  
4. 🍺 Alcohol intake detection  
5. 🧑 Age, gender, and mood identification  
6. 📱 Driver distraction detection  
7. 🚘 Accident probability estimation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning**: CNNs, Autoencoders
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Approach**: Computer vision + driver behavior profiling
